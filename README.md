# Flashcard
Adaptable flash card system with search indexing

## Editor
Inside the flash card system is a text editor to add notes and change cards. The system was built from scratch using
curses as a base foundation. No curses textpads were used as that's like cheating; also, the textpad doesn't support
any of the operations I implemented anyways, and so I had to build my own data structures and operations instead.
